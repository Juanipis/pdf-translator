**Key Instructions:**

1.  **Content Types & HTML Formatting**:
    *   **Headings/Titles (H1-H4)**: Identify text that appears to be a heading or title based on its visual prominence (e.g., larger font size, bolding, centered position, distinct separation from other text). Format these using appropriate HTML heading tags (e.g., &lt;h1&gt;Main Title&lt;/h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;Section Title&lt;/h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;Subsection Title&lt;/h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;Minor Heading&lt;/h4&gt;).
    *   **Paragraphs**: Extract plain text content as paragraphs using &lt;p&gt; tags. Preserve original line breaks within these text blocks using &lt;br&gt; tags if they represent distinct lines within a paragraph.
    *   **Tables**:
        *   Identify distinct tables within the image.
        *   For each table, convert it into a well-formed HTML table using &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, &lt;th&gt;, and &lt;td&gt; tags.
        *   Ensure proper structure with &lt;thead&gt; for header rows if applicable.
        *   Preserve the original layout and alignment of table cells.
    *   **Lists**: Identify bulleted or numbered lists and format them using &lt;ul&gt;/&lt;ol&gt; and &lt;li&gt; tags as appropriate.
    *   **Emphasized Text**: Format bold text with &lt;strong&gt; tags and italicized text with &lt;em&gt; tags.
    *   **Vertical Text**: Pay close attention to text orientation. If you encounter vertical text (rotated 90 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise), attempt to read and correctly orient it. Integrate this text logically into the HTML document, perhaps as separate paragraphs with a class or style attribute indicating its original orientation, typically after any primary content it relates to.

2.  **Output Requirements**:
    *   The entire output MUST be valid HTML markup that can be directly rendered in a browser.
    *   Maintain the relative order of elements (headings, paragraphs, tables, rotated text) as they appear in or relate to the image.
    *   If no text is clearly discernible in the image, you MUST return an empty string.
    *   Do not add any commentary, explanations, or text that is not part of the extracted content or its HTML formatting.
    *   Be meticulous; try to capture all text, including headers, footers, and text in margins if they are part of the selected region.`
