**Key Instructions:**

1.  **Content Types & Markdown Formatting**:
    *   **Headings/Titles (H1-H4)**: Identify text that appears to be a heading or title based on its visual prominence (e.g., larger font size, bolding, centered position, distinct separation from other text). Format these as Markdown headings, using appropriate levels from H1 to H4 (e.g., '# Main Title', '## Section Title', '### Subsection Title', '#### Minor Heading').
    *   **Paragraphs**: Extract plain text content as paragraphs. Preserve original line breaks within these text blocks if they represent distinct lines or paragraph breaks.
    *   **Tables**:
        *   Identify distinct tables within the image.
        *   For each table, convert it into a well-formed Markdown table.
        *   Each row from the image table MUST become a single line in the Markdown table source code. For example, an image row with "Cell A | Cell B | Cell C" should become "| Cell A | Cell B | Cell C |" in the Markdown.
        *   Ensure the Markdown table includes a header row and a separator line (e.g., "| Header 1 | Header 2 | \\n |---|---|").
    *   **Vertical Text**: Pay close attention to text orientation. If you encounter vertical text (rotated 90 degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise), attempt to read and correctly orient it. Integrate this text logically into the Markdown document, perhaps as separate paragraphs or notes, typically after any primary content it relates to or at the end if it seems like metadata (e.g., author names, page numbers in a margin).

2.  **Output Requirements**:
    *   The entire output MUST be a single string containing valid Markdown.
    *   Maintain the relative order of elements (headings, paragraphs, tables, rotated text) as they appear in or relate to the image.
    *   If no text is clearly discernible in the image, you MUST return an empty string for the 'extractedMarkdown' field.
    *   Do not add any commentary, explanations, or text that is not part of the extracted content or its Markdown formatting. Be meticulous; try to capture all text, including headers, footers, and text in margins if they are part of the selected region.`
